# An Algorithm a Day

```
"An algorithm a day keeps the coder in sway"
```

This is a personal goal I've set to solve one algorithm problem every day for as long as I can. 

## Problems solved
- freeCodeCamp.com: Basic Algorithm Scripting (solved)
- freeCodeCamp.com: Intermediate Algorithm Scripting (solved)
- Project Euler: Problems 1 - 100
